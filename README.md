Grand Theift Auto IV russian localization path for 1.0.6.0-1.0.8.0 versions (tested on 1.0.7.0)
--------------------------------------------------

"Tested on version 1.0.7.0. Install into the standard game directory. Attention! After installation, there will be no English text translation in the game. There is no need to switch the language in the game! You assume all responsibility for applying this patch, so make a backup of the game before experimenting! For installation, allow the patch administrative access so it can overwrite the necessary game files and confirm this operation if necessary. Possible bugs include incomplete translation of episode titles and, on 3:4 screens, the rightmost section of the menu may not fit (use the cursor arrow keys)."
